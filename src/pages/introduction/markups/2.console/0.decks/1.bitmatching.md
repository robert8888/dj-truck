#### What means that tracks are in synchronization ?
Tracks are in synchronization if the have equal tempo e.i time of beat are the same,
and each beat start at the same time simultaneously. In music and music theory, 
the beat is the basic unit of time, (regularly repeating event). T approx we can
assume that in most of the track this means fourth beats of kick. Second part of
synchronization is ensured that each beat (to be more precise first kick of the beat)
sounded in the same time. The diff between this kick beats are displayed by
synchronization bar (first point in above screenshot)
